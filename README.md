# PostcodeChecker
Tools for UK postcodes

## Why?
Seems I keep doing this at every job and every other feature.  
Usually you end up working with someone else's half baked algorithm, not covered by comprehensive testing.  
What's the problem? You guessed it: everytime you add a new case, or tweak the algorithm, you break something else.  

Well, no more! I decided to do this as a TDD Kata, and make it a library that other people can use.  
The test coverage confidence introduced by the TDD approach ensures we don't have regression errors and we can cover every case/scenario we set out to cover

## What's the status?
Currently it works with all the post code formats in the UK that I'm aware of.  
Again, please let me know if this is not the case!

## Contributing?
Sure! Throw a PR my way.
I will require simple, clean tests. Think TDD Approach: test must be clear and concise, and the simplest, easiest thing to make that test pass is implemented.
Only then you have authorization to refactor :)

## CI?
None yet, but if this gains traction I'll set up AppVeyor or TC.

## Found an issue?
Please do raise an issue :) let's discuss!
