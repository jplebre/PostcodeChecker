## Why?
Seems I keep doing this at every job and every other feature. Usually you end up working with someone else's half baked algorithm, not covered by comprehensive testing.
Well, no more! I decided to do this as a TDD Kata, and make it a library that other people can use.

## Contributing?
Sure! Throw a PR my way.
I will require simple, clean tests. Think TDD Approach: test must be clear and concise, and the simplest, easiest thing to make that test pass is implemented.
Only then you have authorization to refactor :)

## CI?
None yet, but if this gains traction I'll set up AppVeyor or TC.

## Found an issue?
Please do raise an issue :) let's discuss!
